# dict.js

##### dict.js adds a dictionary class to javaScript

---

In a dictionary (also called associative array) you can acces objects of an array through a key, which can be a number as well as a string. Thats why you call them key➡value pairs.
Dictionaries are used in Python, Java, PHP and many other programming languanges but not in JS!
So enjoy this little code snippet.

---

- use `new dict()` to create a dict object

* use `add(key, value)` to add a key-value-pair (keys have to be unique)

- use `getByKey(key)` to get a value by its key

- use `length` to get the number of keys (which should also be the number of values)

- use `k(key)` as an alias for `getByKey()`
